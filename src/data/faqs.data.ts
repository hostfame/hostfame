    question: "What is disk space and how much do I need?",
    answer:
      "Disk space is the amount of storage available for your website files (HTML, images, databases, emails, etc.). Small brochure sites often use less than 1GB, but dynamic sites or media-heavy projects may need more. You can upgrade storage anytime.",

    id: "q2",
    categoryId: "hosting",
    question: "Is disk space matter for website speed?",
    answer:
